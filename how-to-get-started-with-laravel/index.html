                            <p>Install Laravel and Prerequisites
                                To install Laravel, you will need to have PHP, Composer, and a web server (such as Apache or Nginx) installed on your machine.
                            </p>
                            <h6><strong>1.Install PHP:</strong></h6>

                            <h6><strong>3.Install a web server:</strong></h6>
                            <p>You will also need a web server such as Apache or Nginx. These can be downloaded and installed from their respective websites (https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi and https://nginx.org/en/download.html)
                                These Steps can be followed if you want to tackle each Prerequisites and get more grip on them or if you want to start immediately then you can download the XAMPP it is software which consist of all the required tools to getting started with PHP development you can download it from here XAMPP-Download.
                                XAMPP consists of Apace server and PHP and MySQL, and install and start the server, you can download the Composer from the above step 2
                                Once you have these prerequisites installed, you can install Laravel using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:</p>
                            <mark><i><b>composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app</b></i></mark>                    
                            <p>This command will create a new Laravel project in a directory called "example-app".
                                After the project has been created, start Laravel's local development server using the Laravel's Artisan CLI serve command:
                            </p>
                            <mark><i><b>cd example-app</b></i></mark>   
                            <mark><i><b>cd example-app</b></i></mark>
                            <p>Laravel's Artisan CLI serve command this command will start a web server on your local host at http://localhost:8000</p> 
                            <h5><b>Step-2</b></h5>
                            <h6><strong>Install Bootstrap</strong></h6>
                            <p>To install Bootstrap, firstly you should have the NPM installed in your machine it is very simple to install choose an stable build for better understanding then use this command on your application root directory
                                To install the ui packages
                                <mark><i><b>composer require laravel/ui</b></i></mark>
                                to install the UI with bootstrap
                                <mark><i><b>php artisan ui bootstrap</b></i></mark>
                                the below command is to add an authentication layer instantly to Laravel project
                                <mark><i><b>php artisan ui bootstrap –auth</b></i></mark>
                                to add the libraries
                                <mark><i><b>npm install</b></i></mark>

                            <p>These commands will install the necessary files for bootstrapping Laravel with bootstrap.
                                You will see a output below
                            </p>
                            <img src="images/img-1.png" alt="">
                            <p>These two files app-67dcdcdfd2.css and app-58d79ea6.js will serve as the main source files for your entire applications
                            </p>
                            <h5><b>Step-3</b></h5>

                            <p>In order to connect to a database, you will need to configure your database settings in the .env file located in the root of your project. You will need to update the following fields:
                            </p>
                            <mark><i><b>DB_CONNECTION=mysql</b></i></mark>
                            <h5><b>Step-4</b></h5>
                            <h6><b>Create a Model, Migration, and Controller</b></h6>
                            <p>To create a model that represents the tasks table in the database, you can use the following command:
                            </p>
                            <mark><i><b>php artisan make:model Task -m</b></i></mark>
                            <p>this command will create a model and migration file for the Task.</p>
                            <h5><b>Step-5</b></h5>
                            <h6><b>Create an API </b></h6>
                            <p>To create an API that helps to store day-to-day tasks on the server, you can use the following command:</p> 
                            <mark><i><strong>php artisan make:controller TaskController </strong></i></mark>
                            <p>This command will create a new controller for the Application it will handle all the core components of your application including redirecting , forwarding requests , getting data from the data base and session handling and Validation and more. 
                                Now we need to define an route to user to enter our application the default route is / </p>
                            <h5><b>Step-6</b></h5>
                            <h6><b>Define routes</b></h6>
                            <p>In order to define routes for the Application , you can add the following code into your file use:</p>
                            <i><b>App\Http\Controllers\TaskController</b></i>
                            <i><b>Route::get('/’,function(){</b></i>
                            <i><b>return view('welcome’);</b></i>
                            <i><b>});</b></i>
                            <i><b>Route::post('/task/,[TaskController::class,'index']);</b></i>
